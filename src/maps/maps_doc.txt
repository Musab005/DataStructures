Methods to Implement:

__init__(self, size=16): Creates the internal dynamic array of a certain size.

_hash(self, key): A private method that takes a key and returns an index (e.g., hash(key) % self.size).

set(self, key, value) or __setitem__: Hashes the key to find the bucket index.If the bucket is empty, create a new
Linked List there. Search the Linked List in that bucket for the key. If it exists, update the value. If it doesn't,
append a new (key, value) pair to the Linked List.

get(self, key) or __getitem__: Hashes the key to find the bucket. Searches the Linked List in that bucket for the key
and returns its value. If not found, raise a KeyError.

remove(self, key): Hashes the key, finds the bucket, and uses your LinkedList.remove_by_value to remove the (key, value)
pair.
